# Pwc-Power-BI-Virtual-Internship
This repository consolidates a series of Power BI projects undertaken during my virtual internship with PwC via Forage.
## Projects

### 1. Call Centre Trends
The objective of this project was to provide a comprehensive view of customer support performance, facilitating informed decision-making and enhancing overall efficiency. Leveraging Power BI's capabilities, I designed a user-friendly dashboard that presents crucial KPIs at a glance.

**Key Features:**

**Overall Customer Satisfaction:** Utilizes sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction based on provided ratings.

**Call Analytics:** Visual representations of overall calls answered/abandoned, calls by time, and average speed of answer, aiding in the analysis of call management trends.

**Agent Performance Quadrant:** Presents a unique quadrant analysis based on average handle time vs calls answered, offering a visual assessment of agent performance.

### 2. Customer Retention
I developed a powerful dashboard designed to address key challenges faced in customer retention. The project emphasizes proactive measures to identify and retain customers, shifting from a reactive to a predictive approach.

**Key Features:**

**Customer Overview:** Visualizations providing a clear snapshot of customer demographics, tenure, and service usage patterns.

**Churn Analysis:** In-depth analysis of churn, categorizing customers who are at risk, and identifying trends contributing to customer terminations.

**Ticket Analysis:** Insights into the impact of customer support through the visualization of administrative and technical support tickets.

**Predictive Modeling:** Integration of predictive modelling to forecast potential churn, enabling the retention team to take preemptive measures.

### 3. Diversity & Inclusion
This project revolved around defining key performance indicators (KPIs) related to gender balance and diversity, creating impactful visualizations, and delving into the root causes of slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level.
